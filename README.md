# 🎵 Spotify Skip Predictor

A powerful machine learning application designed to predict whether a Spotify track will be skipped during a user's listening session. By leveraging user behavior and acoustic features of tracks, this app aims to enhance music recommendation systems.

## 🚀 Features

- **Skip Prediction**: ML model predicts the likelihood of a track being skipped.
- **Interactive Front-End**: User-friendly interface to input track data and view predictions.
- **Acoustic Feature Analysis**: Visualizes track features like tempo, energy, and danceability.
- **User Behavior Insights**: Displays skip patterns based on user interactions.
- **Scalable Pipeline**: Integrates backend ML model with a responsive front-end.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
📦 Spotify-Skip-Predictor
├── app.py               # Streamlit front-end application (assumed)
├── main.py              # Backend ML model script
├── data/               # Dataset storage (e.g., CSV/JSON files)
├── models/             # Trained ML models
├── static/             # Static assets for front-end (e.g., CSS, images)
├── templates/          # HTML templates (if using Flask/Django)

```

## 💻 Getting Started

### 🔧 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FarazhussainAI250/Spotify-Skip-Predictor.git
cd Spotify-Skip-Predictor
```

### 📦 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note*: Ensure `requirements.txt` includes dependencies like:
```text
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
spotipy
streamlit  # For front-end (assumed)
```

### 🔑 3. Set Up Spotify API (Optional)

1. Create a Spotify Developer account at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/).
2. Obtain `client_id` and `client_secret`.
3. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id'
   export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret'
   ```

### ▶️ 4. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your default browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501/`).

*Note*: If using a different front-end framework (e.g., Flask, React), replace `app.py` with the relevant script (e.g., `python server.py` or `npm start`).

## 🧮 How It Works

1. **Input Track Data**:
   - Users input track details (e.g., track ID, acoustic features) via the web interface.
   - Example input: Track ID, tempo, energy, danceability.
2. **Backend Processing**:
   - The ML model processes the input and predicts skip probability.
   - Backend script (`main.py`) handles data processing and model inference.
3. **Front-End Display**:
   - Results are displayed as predictions (e.g., "80% chance of skip").
   - Visualizations (e.g., bar charts of acoustic features) are shown using Streamlit/Matplotlib.
4. **Integration**:
   - Predictions can be used to improve Spotify's recommendation algorithms.

## 🎨 Front-End Details

- **Framework**: Streamlit (assumed, replace with actual framework if different).
- **Features**:
  - Input form for track details.
  - Real-time prediction display.
  - Interactive charts for feature analysis.
- **Styling**: Clean, dark-themed UI with responsive design.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- Add support for uploading track data via CSV.
- Integrate real-time Spotify API data fetching.
- Enhance UI with advanced visualizations (e.g., Plotly charts).
- Deploy the app to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
