# 🎵 Spotify Skip Predictor

A powerful machine learning application designed to predict whether a Spotify track will be skipped during a user's listening session. By leveraging user behavior and acoustic features of tracks, this app aims to enhance music recommendation systems.

## 🚀 Features

- **Skip Prediction**: Uses machine learning models to predict track skip probability.
- **Acoustic Feature Analysis**: Incorporates features like tempo, energy, danceability, and more.
- **User Behavior Modeling**: Analyzes user interaction data to identify skip patterns.
- **Scalable Pipeline**: Built to process large datasets and integrate with Spotify API (if used).
- **Interactive Analysis**: Outputs clear predictions for integration into recommendation systems.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
📦 Spotify-Skip-Predictor
├── main.py              # Main script for running the model
├── data/               # Dataset storage (e.g., CSV/JSON files)
├── models/             # Trained ML models
├── requirements.txt    # Required dependencies
```

## 💻 Getting Started

### 🔧 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FarazhussainAI250/Spotify-Skip-Predictor.git
cd Spotify-Skip-Predictor
```

### 📦 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note*: Ensure `requirements.txt` includes dependencies like:
```text
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
spotipy
```

### 🔑 3. Set Up Spotify API (Optional)

1. Create a Spotify Developer account at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/).
2. Obtain `client_id` and `client_secret`.
3. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id'
   export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret'
   ```

### ▶️ 4. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

*Note*: Replace `app.py` with the actual script name if different.

## 🧮 How It Works

1. **Input Data**: Provide a dataset with user listening sessions and track features (e.g., CSV or JSON).
   - Example dataset structure:
     ```text
     session_id, track_id, user_id, skip_label, tempo, energy, danceability
     ```
2. **Model Training**: The app trains a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) on the dataset.
3. **Prediction**: Outputs the probability of a track being skipped.
4. **Integration**: Results can be used to improve Spotify's recommendation algorithms.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- Add real-time prediction using Spotify API.
- Support for advanced models like neural networks.
- Visualize skip patterns with interactive dashboards.
- Add support for batch processing of multiple users.
